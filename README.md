## Methodology
React was used in the development of this application. Movies were fetched from OMDB using their publically accessible API endpoint. Some of the considerations taken in building this application are:

 - **Accessibility**: Polaris was used for this project because of its accessible components that come out of the box (Some of the reasons i love Polaris). Automatically the application can be navigated using just your keyboard. You can move through the movie list by pressing Tab and put a movie up for nomination by pressing enter. 
 - **Interactivity**: Giving the user the best experience is always a focus for me and to achieve this i added the following features: To give the user the best search experience, while typing in the movie name, the application automatically fetches movies from OMDB without the user pressing enter. To make sure we don't pester the API with too many requests from each keystroke, a debounce was used to only send a request after 300ms. Users won't need to worry about their nominations disappearing after reloading the page as every nomination is saved locally on the user's browser. Users are also easily able to share their nominations with friends by copying a shareable link or sharing it directly on social media.
 
 - **Responsiveness**: Polaris also does a great job with mobile responsiveness with custom fonts for different screen sizes and their flexible layouts, making it a breeze to build responsive designs. The application can easily be used by mobile device users.

 ## Tools Used üõ†Ô∏è
